Project Overview

This project demonstrates the working principles of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm through an interactive visualization platform.

The system allows real-time experimentation with K values and distance metrics to observe classification behavior and confidence levels.

Features

Adjustable K parameter

Euclidean distance-based classification

Weighted and unweighted voting

Confidence percentage display

Performance score tracking

Decision boundary visualization

Key Learnings

Impact of K on bias–variance tradeoff

Distance metric influence on classification

Model sensitivity to local data distribution

Confidence score interpretation

Tools Used
